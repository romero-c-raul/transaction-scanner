# Project Conventions

## Readability First

All code is reviewed by a developer who is learning frontend concepts and libraries (React, Next.js, Tesseract.js, shadcn/ui, etc.). Optimize every line for readability:

- Extract inline callbacks and complex expressions into named variables
- Keep functions short and flat — avoid nesting beyond 2 levels
- Use descriptive variable names, no abbreviations
- Add brief comments explaining **why** when using non-obvious framework patterns or library APIs (e.g., why `try/finally` without `catch`, why a specific Tesseract option)
- No clever one-liners — prefer clear over concise
